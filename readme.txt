Create Asana tasks directly from Gravity Forms submissions, streamlining project management.

== Description ==

**Integrate Asana with Gravity Forms** allows you to seamlessly automate task creation in Asana from any form submission in Gravity Forms. With just a few clicks, you can set up forms to trigger the creation of tasks, making it easier to manage projects. This plugin eliminates the need for manual task entry, ensuring your team's workflow stays streamlined and efficient.

Perfect for teams using Gravity Forms to collect data, applications, surveys, customer inquiries, or project requests, this integration provides a direct connection to Asana, so nothing gets missed. Whether it's a new task based on a client inquiry or an internal project submission, you can stay organized and boost productivity by automating the process of creating tasks in Asana directly from your website’s forms.

### Why It's Great
This plugin saves time and improves both efficiency and accuracy by automating task creation in Asana. You can collect detailed information through Gravity Forms and immediately turn it into actionable tasks for your team in Asana. Plus, with advanced customization options in the premium version, it becomes a flexible solution for businesses making full use of Asana’s powerful features.

### Key Features:
- **Automatic Task Creation:** Simplify project management by automating the creation of tasks in Asana from Gravity Form submissions. With this feature, every time a form is submitted, the plugin automatically generates a task in Asana, including all relevant form data.
This ensures a consistent, error-free workflow, minimizing the time and effort required to manually enter tasks, and allowing you to focus on higher-priority activities. Whether it’s a support request, a project brief, or an internal feedback form, tasks are instantly added to your Asana boards, keeping your project pipeline moving smoothly.

- **Field Mapping:** With this feature, you can directly map fields from Gravity Forms to specific attributes in Asana tasks. For instance, form fields like name, email, project details, or submission date can be mapped to key Asana task elements such as task title, description, or due date.
This ensures that all crucial information collected in your forms is accurately transferred to Asana without missing any important details. The field mapping is fully customizable, enabling you to tailor how your data is captured in Asana for different forms and projects. This results in a more organized, context-rich task-creation process, reducing miscommunication and streamlining workflows.

- **Conditional Logic:** Take control of task creation with conditional logic that allows you to define exactly when and how tasks are created in Asana. You can set specific conditions for task creation based on form field values, ensuring that only relevant submissions generate tasks.
For example, you might configure the plugin to create a task only if a certain option is selected on the form, or if the submission meets particular criteria (e.g., a high-priority request). This selective task creation helps prevent unnecessary task clutter in Asana and ensures that only actionable items are added to your project management system, keeping your team’s focus where it matters most.

- **Seamless Integration:** Designed to integrate effortlessly into your existing workflows, the plugin provides a user-friendly setup and connects Gravity Forms with Asana without disrupting your current processes. Once installed and configured, the plugin works behind the scenes to handle task creation, keeping your Asana projects automatically updated with new tasks as form submissions come in.
It integrates with all types of Asana accounts and requires no advanced technical knowledge to set up. The intuitive interface makes it easy to manage task creation rules, mappings, and custom triggers, allowing you to set it once and let it run smoothly with little need for ongoing adjustments. This seamless integration empowers your team to focus on project execution rather than administrative setup.

- **Premium Version Features:** Unlock a new level of functionality and customization by upgrading to the premium version of the Gravity Forms Asana plugin. With the premium features, you can handle more complex workflows, manage larger projects, and tailor your feeds to meet the specific needs of your team. Here’s what you can do with the premium upgrade:
1. File Uploads
Enhance your task management by automatically attaching files uploaded through Gravity Forms to Asana tasks. If your forms collect documents, images, or other types of files, this feature allows those attachments to be transferred directly to the associated task in Asana.
Whether it's a design mockup, a signed contract, or any other file type, the premium version ensures that all related assets are included with the task, making it easier for your team to access all the necessary information in one place.

2. Custom Fields
Asana’s custom fields offer additional flexibility in organizing and tracking your tasks, and the premium version of the plugin allows you to map Gravity Forms data directly to these custom fields.
For example, if your form collects data beyond standard task details—such as budget information, priority level, or project category—you can map this information to corresponding custom fields in Asana. This creates richer, more detailed tasks that not only give your team more context at a glance, but can be further processed using custom rules in Asana.

3. Task Sections
Keep your tasks organized within Asana by assigning them to specific sections of a project. With the premium version, you can choose which section of an Asana project the new task should be placed in. This is particularly useful for teams that work in highly structured projects, where tasks are categorized into different stages (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Completed").
You can configure your Gravity Forms submissions to automatically sort tasks into the appropriate sections based on form responses, ensuring that tasks are routed to the right place for faster action and better project management.

By upgrading to the premium version, you'll have access to advanced features that streamline your workflows even further, making it ideal for teams with specialized needs or larger projects that require detailed task tracking and organization.
